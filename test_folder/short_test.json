Thus, many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Some issue polling has shown Trump, the 2024 Presidential Republican nominee, outrunning his party and closing the gap with Democrats on the issue of abortion, but no election data with Trump directly on the ballot has happened to verify these results.", "masks": ["Biden"]}
